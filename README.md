This project is a practice implementation of authentication using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It includes user registration, login, and protected routes with JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure session management.

## Features

- **User Registration:** New users can register by providing their name, email, and password.
- **User Login:** Registered users can log in with their email and password.
- **JWT Authentication:** Secure authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens.
- **Protected Routes:** Access control to certain routes based on user authentication status.
- **Password Hashing:** User passwords are securely hashed before storage in the database using bcrypt.
- **Responsive Design:** The frontend is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
- **State Management:** State is managed efficiently using Zustand.
- **Animations:** Smooth animations and transitions are implemented using Framer Motion.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React, Axios, Zustand, Framer Motion
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose
- **Authentication:** JWT, bcrypt
